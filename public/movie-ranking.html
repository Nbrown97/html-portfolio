<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Into the Wild</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Movie. I love the wilderness setting and the "living off the grid aspect".</p>
<h3>The Love Guru</h3>
<p>One of the best comedys in my opinion. Mike Meyers is the main character in this movie.</p>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>Who doesnt love nice cars that turn into auto-bots.</p>
